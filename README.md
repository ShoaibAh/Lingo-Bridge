# 🌉 Lingo-Bridge: Multilingual Repo Onboarding Agent

**Breaking the language barrier in Open Source, one repository at a time.**

Built for the [Lingo.dev Multilingual Hackathon 2026](https://luma.com/wv9mbyal).

---

## 📖 The Problem
Open Source is global, but documentation is not. Over **75% of the world's population** does not speak English fluently, yet the vast majority of top GitHub repositories are English-only. This creates a "Language Wall" that prevents thousands of talented developers from contributing to world-changing projects.

## ✨ The Solution: Lingo-Bridge
**Lingo-Bridge** is an AI-powered onboarding sidekick that transforms any English-centric repository into a localized, welcoming environment for global contributors. By leveraging the **Lingo.dev ecosystem**, it allows developers to interact with codebases, read documentation, and track issues in their native tongue—without the maintainers ever having to manually translate a single line.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Lingo.dev Integration
To maximize impact and technical depth, Lingo-Bridge utilizes the full Lingo.dev suite:

* **Lingo MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Connects the AI Agent (Cursor/Claude) directly to Lingo’s translation engine, allowing the agent to "understand" and translate repo context on the fly.
* **Lingo SDK:** Used for dynamic, real-time translation of GitHub Issues and contributor discussions.
* **Lingo Compiler:** Powering our web dashboard with a **"Zero-Refactor"** approach—ensuring the UI is localized instantly for every user.
* **Lingo CLI:** Automates the creation of localized documentation (`README.es.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.zh.md`, etc.) via GitHub Actions.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Context-Aware Translation:** Uses AI to ensure technical terms (like "middleware" or "rebase") are translated accurately within a developer's context.
* **On-the-Fly Docs:** Generate localized versions of any `.md` file in the repo with a single command.
* **Interactive Issue Bridge:** Submit issues in your native language; Lingo-Bridge translates them for maintainers while keeping your view localized.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v18+)
* A [Lingo.dev](https://lingo.dev) API Key
* An MCP-enabled IDE (like Cursor)

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShoaibAh/lingo-bridge.git
    cd lingo-bridge
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Initialize Lingo:**
    ```bash
    npx lingo.dev@latest init
    ```
4.  **Set up the MCP Server:**
    Add the following command to your IDE's MCP settings:
    
    
    ```javascript
      "mcpServers": {
        "lingo-github-contents": {
          "command": "node",
          "args": ["./lingo-agent.js"],
          "env": {
            "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_TOKEN}",
            "LINGODOTDEV_API_KEY": "${LINGODOTDEV_API_KEY}"
          }
        },
        "lingo-i18n": {
          "url": "https://mcp.lingo.dev/main"
        }
      }
    
    ```

    - ### Server 1: user-lingo-agent (lingo-agent) ###
    - 1. `localize_github_issue`
       - Fetches a GitHub issue and uses lingo.dev to translate it for non-English contributors
       - No parameters required
    - 2. `localize_github_readme`
       - Fetches a GitHub repository README and uses lingo.dev to translate it for non-English contributors
       - No parameters required

    - ### Server 2: user-lingo-i18n (lingo-i18n) ###
    - 1. `get_framework_docs`
        - Retrieves framework documentation from official repositories
        - Supports: nextjs-app-router, nextjs-pages-router, tanstack-start, react-router
        - Parameters: framework (required), version (default: "latest"), action ("index" or "read"), section_id (for reading)
    - 2. `get_i18n_library_docs`
        - Retrieves documentation for i18n libraries (currently react-intl)
        - Parameters: library (required, currently only "react-intl"), version, action, section_id
    - 3. `get_project_context`
        - Captures project architecture to inform i18n implementation strategy
        - Parameters: detectionResults (required) - complex object with framework detection, TypeScript, package manager, locales, etc.
    - 4. `i18n_checklist`
        - Mandatory tool for all i18n work - provides a structured 13-step checklist
        - Parameters: step_number (1-13), done (boolean), evidence (array), build_passing (boolean)

## 🎥 Demo
- put prompts like `Hey, add Japanese to my project and translate the onboarding docs` and it will update `i18n.json` with, creates `i18n/js.json` and translates entire README.md adds into newly created `README.ja.md` file.
- prompt like `read the github issue #1979 from faceook/react repo and translate into Hindi` and it will fetch, translates and saves in `issue-1979-hindi.md` in your project directory.

## 🌍 Impact
By making onboarding accessible, we increase the diversity of the Open Source community and accelerate innovation by inviting the "next billion developers" to the table.
